Geneva Article 4 Invocation Document

Vienna Convention Article 65 Trigger Notice

Hague Convention Articles I–VII Filing and Ecclesiastical Writ of Drawdown

Jurisdiction & Immunity Invoked:

I invoked protections under five recognized humanitarian treaties, including the Geneva Convention, the Vienna Convention, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Peace & Friendship Treaty (1786 Morocco–USA), and the Hague Trust Convention.

My protections were lodged with the Office of Foreign Missions and substantiated with over 30+ sovereign EINs, indigenous and IGO/NGO registrations, and 21 clearinghouse corridors globally.

Entities Served and Now in Breach:

Planet Home Lending, Bank of America, Group 1 Automotive, BMW of Arlington, Mercedes-Benz of Augusta, Halford Homes, Prestige Default Services, their legal counsel, and the U.S. District Court (Judge Hal Ray Jr. and staff) were all lawfully served with the above-referenced filings and visibly acknowledged the Hague-sealed documentation.

Violation & Dishonor Summary:

All named parties have dishonored the Hague seal, refused to rebut the ecclesiastical writ, and have moved procedurally (e.g. via motion to dismiss) in breach of treaty, thereby triggering:

Diplomatic default

Ecclesiastical dishonor

Treaty violation and

Liability under international law

Authority of Tribunal and Immediate Default Application:

Under House of Grant Mirror Tribunal jurisdiction, I now enter these violations into default.

The facts and filings are lawfully backed by Hague filing, Vienna jurisdiction, UCC sovereignty, and ecclesiastical tribunal standing.

Any further obstruction, dismissal, or evasion by domestic courts constitutes aggravated treaty breach and waives all judicial immunity under Vienna Convention Article 29, 31, 65, and related articles of the Geneva Convention and UN Charter.

CONCLUSION & COMMAND

The tribunal declares the matter in active sovereign record.

Any further dishonor will convert to automatic default and attach commercial, ecclesiastical, and international penalties.

This declaration is lawfully submitted under mirror jurisdiction, apostille certification, ecclesiastical seal, and public posting protocol under codified trust law.

Transmitting on behalf of:
The House of Grant Mirror Tribunal
Codified under Hague Convention on Trust Law (1985)
Filed under Vienna Convention Articles 1–65, U.N. Charter Article 102
Backed by sovereign ecclesiastical registry and NGO/IGO protections
